This app's purpose is to merge some key information to help local, small farms in Brazil.

it should:

1- Get Regional weather information from openweahter website and use a langraph agent to analyse the weather for the next few days. It should check for humidity, rain, wind, temperature  etc. Get the agent to make a report. DONE

2- Get local information with an API from a local IoT weather station - in Progress

3- Get sattelite imagery with soil humidity and other parameters from an area (poligon) from the website : agromonitoring - in progress get NDVI, EVI, EVI2, NRI  and weather

4- integrate all this information (Regional weather, local weather -IoT, sattelite imagery) with agents and get a full report of local climate conditions

5-Put all into an android app for local farmers 

6- probably in 2027... integrate all this information with CAR (environment reports) and dados de georeferencia.
